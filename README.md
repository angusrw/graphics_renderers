## Rasteriser:
* Basic, interactive rasteriser, using per pixel illumination, clipping and culling
* Achieved first class mark (77)


## Raytracer:
* Basic, interactive raytracer, using direct & indirect illumination
* Attempted to implement Radiosity illumination, incomplete but received marks for work done
* Achieved first class mark (70)

## Instructions: 

Run `make` in chosen directory (`rasteriser/` or `raytracer/`) and then `./Build/main` to launch renderer window

Controls:
* W-A-S-D: move box
* I-J-K-L: rotate box
* UP-LEFT-DOWN-RIGHT: move light
